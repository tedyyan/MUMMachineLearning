### Instructions
#### Data set selection:

- Min of 500 samples ,  must include at least one categorical feature 

#### Objective:

Train several classification models, and practice model tuning (bias/varience) tradeoff

#### Main delivery:

- EDA

- Train at least 4 models (e.g. KNN, DTree,SVM,MLP, Logit) 

-For each model tuning: show complexity curve (validation curve) and learning curve for different hyperparameters 

e.g. for KNN , 2 plots :

-complexity curve shows K and error for (k=1, k=3,k=5 ) 

- pick some value of K , and draw learning curve 

comment on the plot to show how this hyper param affects the bias/varience 

- You must use at least one ensemble ( random forest, voting , boosting) 

- Finally show comparison between all classifier performance  ( AUC curve) 

#### Bonus:

Apply AutoML (e.g. auto sklearn )and compare its performance to your best model
